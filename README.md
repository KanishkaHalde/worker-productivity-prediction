## 📌 Project Overview

This app uses a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict worker productivity.  
It allows users to interactively input factory conditions like:

- Quarter, department, day
- Team number and number of workers
- Targeted productivity
- SMV (Standard Minute Value)
- Overtime, idle time, incentives
- Style changes and WIP (Work In Progress)

And receive an accurate prediction of **actual productivity**.
